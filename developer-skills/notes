# 4 Steps to solve any problem

1. Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right question to get a clear picture of the problem.

2. Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into a smaller sub-problems.

3. Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to.

4. For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code.


# The debugging process
1. IDENTIFY. Becoming aware that there's a bug.

2. FIND. Isolating where exactly the bug is happening in code.

3. FIX. Correct the bug.

4. PREVENT. Preventing in from happening again.
